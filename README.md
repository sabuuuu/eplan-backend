# E-Plan Backend
The E-Plan Backend serves as the backbone for the E-Plan project, facilitating the management of exam schedules and course-related information for universities. Built with Node.js and Express.js, this backend provides a robust and scalable solution for handling data and serving API endpoints to interact with the frontend.

## Features
- Authentication: Implements user authentication to secure access to sensitive endpoints and data.
- Exam Schedule Management: Provides endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting exam schedules for various departments and courses.
- User Management: Facilitates the management of user accounts, including administrators, professors, and students.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for building the backend server and handling asynchronous operations.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js used for creating robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing exam schedules, user information, and other relevant data.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install dependencies using npm install.
- Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in the .env file.
- Run the server using npm start.
- Access the API endpoints to interact with the backend functionality.
